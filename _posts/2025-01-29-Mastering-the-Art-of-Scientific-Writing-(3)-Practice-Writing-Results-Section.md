In this module, we’ll dive into an active editing exercise to refine a paragraph from a results section. The goal is to make the text concise, clear, and focused on the key findings, while avoiding redundancy and unnecessary details. Let’s get started!  

---

## **The Context**  

The paragraph we’re editing comes from a study about running during pregnancy. The table associated with this paragraph provides data on:  
- The percentage of runners who continued running during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  
- How much and how intensely they ran.

## **The Original Paragraph**  

Here’s the original draft of the results section:  

> *The majority of runners ran during pregnancy, with 70% (77 out of 110) running during the first trimester, 55% (60 out of 110) during the second trimester, and 32% (35 out of 110) during the third trimester. From the 77 women who ran during pregnancy, 90% (69 out of 77) reported cutting back on their weekly mileage, and 85% (65 out of 77) reported cutting back on their running intensity. On average, those who ran during pregnancy reduced their weekly mileage to 20.3 ± 9.3 miles and their running intensity to 47.9% ± 21% of their non-pregnant effort. A small number of runners, 3.9% (3 out of 77), reported sustaining a running injury while pregnant. In the postpartum period, 23% (18 out of 77) resumed running within two weeks of giving birth, 45% (35 out of 77) within one month, and 75% (58 out of 77) within two months.*

## **The Editing Process**  

### **Step 1: Identify the Key Points**  
The original paragraph is overly detailed and repetitive. Instead of listing every statistic, we’ll focus on the most important findings:  
1. **70% of runners ran during pregnancy**, with almost a third continuing into the third trimester.  
2. **Runners significantly reduced their mileage and intensity** during pregnancy.  
3. **A small number of runners sustained injuries** while pregnant.  
4. **Postpartum running habits**: Nearly a quarter resumed running within two weeks, and most resumed within two months.

### **Step 2: Simplify and Condense**  

#### **First Sentence**  
- Original: *The majority of runners ran during pregnancy, with 70% (77 out of 110) running during the first trimester, 55% (60 out of 110) during the second trimester, and 32% (35 out of 110) during the third trimester.*  
- Edited: *70% of runners ran during pregnancy (n=77), and almost one-third continued into the third trimester.*  

#### **Second and Third Sentences**  
- Original: *From the 77 women who ran during pregnancy, 90% (69 out of 77) reported cutting back on their weekly mileage, and 85% (65 out of 77) reported cutting back on their running intensity. On average, those who ran during pregnancy reduced their weekly mileage to 20.3 ± 9.3 miles and their running intensity to 47.9% ± 21% of their non-pregnant effort.*  
- Edited: *On average, those who ran during pregnancy greatly curtailed their training—running just 20.3 ± 9.3 miles per week and cutting their intensity to about half of their non-pregnant effort.*  

#### **Fourth Sentence**  
- Original: *A small number of runners, 3.9% (3 out of 77), reported sustaining a running injury while pregnant.*  
- Edited: *Three runners reported sustaining a running injury while pregnant.*  

#### **Fifth Sentence**  
- Original: *In the postpartum period, 23% (18 out of 77) resumed running within two weeks of giving birth, 45% (35 out of 77) within one month, and 75% (58 out of 77) within two months.*  
- Edited: *In the postpartum period, nearly a quarter waited two or fewer weeks to resume running, and most resumed within two months.*

## **The Final Edited Paragraph**  

Here’s the polished version of the results section:  

> *70% of runners ran during pregnancy (n=77), and almost one-third continued into the third trimester. On average, those who ran during pregnancy greatly curtailed their training—running just 20.3 ± 9.3 miles per week and cutting their intensity to about half of their non-pregnant effort. Three runners reported sustaining a running injury while pregnant. In the postpartum period, nearly a quarter waited two or fewer weeks to resume running, and most resumed within two months.*

## **Key Takeaways**  

1. **Focus on the Big Picture**: Highlight the most important findings rather than listing every statistic.  
2. **Avoid Repetition**: Don’t repeat information that’s already in the table.  
3. **Be Concise**: Use simple, direct language to convey your results.  
4. **Use Visual Aids**: Let tables and figures do the heavy lifting for detailed data.

By following these steps, you can transform a cluttered, overly detailed results section into a clear and impactful summary of your findings. Happy editing!
