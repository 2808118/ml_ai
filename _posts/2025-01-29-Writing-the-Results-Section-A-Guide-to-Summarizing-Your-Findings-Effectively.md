In the previous module, we discussed the importance of creating clear and compelling tables and figures that tell the story of your research. Now, it’s time to dive into writing the **Results section**—the part of your manuscript where you present your findings. While this section may seem straightforward, it’s easy to fall into common pitfalls that can make your writing tedious or redundant. In this module, we’ll explore how to write a Results section that is concise, informative, and engaging.

## **What Is the Purpose of the Results Section?**  

The Results section is where you summarize the key findings of your study. It should **complement** your tables and figures, not repeat them. The biggest mistake authors make is simply restating the data from their tables line by line, statistic by statistic. Instead, your goal is to highlight the **big-picture trends**, **simple relationships**, and **key takeaways** from your data.  

For example, if your table lists detailed numerical results, your Results section should focus on summarizing the most important patterns or comparisons. Let’s look at some examples to illustrate this:

## **Examples of Effective Results Sections**  

### Example 1: Summarizing Multiple Outcomes  
> *Over the course of treatment, topiramate was significantly more effective than placebo at improving drinking outcomes on drinks per day, drinks per drinking day, percentage of heavy drinking days, percentage of days abstinent, and log plasma-glutamyl transferase ratio (Table 3).*  

Here, the author provides a high-level summary of multiple outcomes without listing every single number. Readers can refer to **Table 3** for the detailed data.  

### Example 2: Highlighting Trends  
> *The total suicide rates for Australian men and women did not change between 1991 and 2000 because marked decreases in older men and women were offset by increases in younger adults, especially younger men (Table 1).*  

This sentence summarizes a complex trend without overwhelming the reader with numbers. The specifics are available in **Table 1**, but the author has distilled the key message for the reader.

## **What NOT to Do in the Results Section**  

Here’s an example of what **not** to do, using a hypothetical study comparing “bad witches” and “good witches”:  

> *The characteristics of the bad witches and the good witches are shown in Table 1. The mean age of the bad witches was 45 ± 5, and the mean age of the good witches was 36 ± 6. Gender was similar between the groups, with 85% female in the bad witches and 83% female in the good witches. The mean BMI of the bad witches was 28 ± 4, and the mean BMI of the good witches was 24 ± 3...*  

This approach is problematic because it simply repeats the data from the table. Instead, aim for a higher-level summary:  

> *The witches were on average lean and predominantly female (Table 1). Bad witches were significantly older, had higher blood pressure, exercised less, and were more likely to smoke than good witches. More bad witches were unemployed, but this difference did not reach statistical significance.*  

Notice how this version is **shorter**, **more engaging**, and **more useful** to the reader. It highlights the key differences without repeating every number.

## **Tips for Writing an Effective Results Section**  

1. **Break Long or Complex Results into Subsections**: Use informative headings to guide the reader through your findings.  
2. **Complement, Don’t Repeat**: Use the text to highlight trends, relationships, or key numbers, and refer readers to tables and figures for details.  
3. **Highlight Important Comparisons**: If your study compares groups (e.g., treatment vs. control), emphasize the most critical differences.  
4. **Include Negative Results**: Findings that don’t support your hypothesis are just as important as those that do.  
5. **Use “Significant” Carefully**: Reserve this term for statistically significant results to avoid confusion.  
6. **Avoid Mixing Methods and Results**: Explain your statistical approach in the Methods section, and focus on findings in the Results section.  
7. **Use the Correct Verb Tense**:  
   - Use the **past tense** for completed actions (e.g., *we found*, *the average reaction time was*).  
   - Use the **present tense** for assertions that remain true (e.g., *Figure 1 shows*, *the data suggest*).  
8. **Use the Active Voice**: It’s more lively and easier to read. For example:  
   - Passive: *It was found that...*  
   - Active: *We found that...* or *The data revealed that...*

## **Final Thoughts**  

The Results section is your opportunity to guide readers through your findings in a clear and engaging way. By focusing on **big-picture trends**, **key comparisons**, and **complementary summaries** of your tables and figures, you can create a Results section that is both informative and enjoyable to read.  

Remember, your readers are smart—they don’t need you to read the table for them. Instead, help them understand what matters most in your data.
