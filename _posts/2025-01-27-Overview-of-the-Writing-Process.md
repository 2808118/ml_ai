Recently, I had the opportunity to watch _Writing in the Sciences_ by Kristin Sainani, an associate professor at Stanford University. This insightful course offers a deep dive into the principles of clear and effective scientific communication, making it an invaluable resource for researchers, academics, and anyone passionate about sharing knowledge.

Inspired by her expertise and engaging teaching style, I’ve decided to reflect on what I’ve learned and share my own journey in improving scientific writing.

Writing in the sciences can be a daunting task, but breaking the process into distinct phases can make it more efficient, enjoyable, and productive. In this blog, we’ll explore a three-phase approach to scientific writing: **prewriting**, **writing the first draft**, and **revision**. With the rise of generative AI (GenAI), these phases are becoming even more streamlined, but the core principles remain essential for producing high-quality manuscripts.

## The Three Phases of Scientific Writing

### 1. **Prewriting Phase: The Foundation of Success**

The prewriting phase is arguably the most critical step in the writing process. It’s where you lay the groundwork for your manuscript by organizing your thoughts, data, and key messages.

#### Key Activities:

- **Collect and Synthesize Information**: Gather all necessary data, references, and background information.
    
- **Create a Roadmap**: Outline the structure of your manuscript, including sections and key points for each paragraph.
    
- **Brainstorm Away from the Computer**: Use downtime (e.g., during exercise or commuting) to think creatively about your manuscript’s structure and main ideas.
    

#### Why It Matters:

Skipping the prewriting phase often leads to disorganization, inefficiency, and distractions during writing. A well-organized roadmap ensures that the actual writing process is smoother and more focused.

#### The Role of GenAI:

GenAI can assist in the prewriting phase by helping brainstorm ideas, generate outlines, and even suggest relevant references. However, the human touch is still crucial for designing experiments, formulating new ideas, and crafting a clear roadmap.

### 2. **Writing the First Draft: Capturing Ideas, Not Perfection**

The first draft is where you transform your roadmap into prose. The key here is to focus on getting your ideas down without worrying about perfection.

#### Key Tips:

- **Don’t Be a Perfectionist**: Your goal is to capture ideas and logical organization, not polished prose.
    
- **Write Quickly and Efficiently**: Use your prewriting roadmap to guide your writing and avoid getting bogged down by sentence-level details.
    
- **Avoid Editing While Writing**: Save refinement for the revision phase to maintain focus on the big picture.
    

#### Why It Matters:

Trying to perfect your writing during the first draft slows down the process and can lead to frustration. By focusing on high-level ideas, you can produce a draft more efficiently.

#### The Role of GenAI:

GenAI can help generate a first draft quickly by turning your outline into prose. However, it’s essential to review and refine the output to ensure accuracy and alignment with your scientific goals.

### 3. **Revision Phase: Where Elegance Happens**

Revision is where your manuscript truly comes to life. This phase involves refining your draft for clarity, coherence, and elegance.

#### Key Strategies:

- **Read Your Writing Out Loud**: This helps identify awkward phrasing, repetition, or wordiness.
    
- **Check Your Verbs**: Replace weak or passive verbs with dynamic, precise ones to make your writing more engaging.
    
- **Cut Ruthlessly**: Eliminate unnecessary jargon, repetition, and dead weight words.
    
- **Organizational Review**: Tag each paragraph with its main point to assess logical flow and reduce redundancy.
    
- **Seek Feedback**: Ask colleagues or mentors outside your field to review your manuscript for clarity and coherence.
    

#### Why It Matters:

Revision transforms a rough draft into a polished manuscript. It’s where you refine your arguments, improve sentence structure, and ensure your work is accessible to your audience.

#### The Role of GenAI:

GenAI can assist in revision by suggesting edits, improving sentence structure, and identifying inconsistencies. However, human judgment is still essential for ensuring scientific accuracy and maintaining the manuscript’s voice.

## Time Allocation for Each Phase

The instructor suggests the following time allocation for each phase:

- **50–70% on Prewriting**: Planning and organizing.
    
- **10–30% on Writing the First Draft**: Quickly getting ideas down.
    
- **20% on Revision**: Refining and improving the draft.
    

This allocation emphasizes the importance of preparation and revision over the actual drafting process, which can be the most challenging and time-consuming step.

## Final Checks Before Submission

Before submitting your manuscript, conduct a thorough final review to ensure consistency, accuracy, and proper referencing.

#### Key Checks:

- **Numerical Consistency**: Ensure all data and statements are consistent throughout the manuscript.
    
- **Avoid "References to Nowhere"**: Verify that all cited references support your claims and are accurate.
    
- **Cite Primary Sources**: Avoid citation propagation by tracking down original studies.
    
- **Use Reference Manager Tools**: Tools like EndNote can help manage references and avoid errors.
    

#### Why It Matters:

Inconsistencies and inaccurate references can raise red flags for reviewers and editors, undermining the credibility of your work.

## Conclusion

By breaking the writing process into three distinct phases—prewriting, drafting, and revision—you can improve efficiency, maintain focus, and produce higher-quality manuscripts. With the help of GenAI, tasks like drafting and revision are becoming more convenient, but the human touch remains essential for creativity, critical thinking, and scientific rigor.

Whether you’re a seasoned researcher or a novice writer, adopting this structured approach can make scientific writing less stressful and more rewarding. Happy writing!
